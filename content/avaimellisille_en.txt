OtaHoas Keyholder Rules and Instructions

For Keyholders

These rules apply to all keyholders.

Keys are only for OtaHoas residents. If you move out of OtaHoas, please return your key immediately. You are also obligated to return your key in any situation where the residents' committee decides so. If you are unreachable for a long period of time, return the key to OtaHoas for that period.

Keys are strictly personal and must not be handed over to anyone under any circumstances, except to a current member of the residents' committee. The residents' committee decides on all key distributions and transfers.

If, despite the prohibition, you give the key to a third party, you are fully responsible for everything related to it, such as theft, vandalism, or other misuse.

KEYS MUST NOT BE GIVEN TO OTHER PEOPLE.

You may not ask for or give money for the use of the facilities.

You commit to handling reservations in the way decided by the residents' committee and to opening doors for reservations. Currently this means using email and Telegram.

You commit to checking the facilities and any related equipment for reservations.

You commit to reporting any problems, faults, disturbances, theft, vandalism, or other misuse and incidents to the residents' committee immediately, unless you are able to resolve them yourself right away.

About Reservations

As a keyholder, you accept or reject reservations within the following rules:

OtaHoas resources (club rooms) are only for OtaHoas residents. They must not be reserved for associations or on behalf of associations. Exceptions are association founding meetings, or if the residents' committee grants an exception.

A request must be formally valid and must arrive to the email mailing list before it can be approved. If a request does not go to the mailing list, the reservation does not exist. If the request is not valid, the request does not exist.

As a keyholder, you may of course ask the requester to complete their request in the same email thread.

In addition, regarding Telegram and the end time, some flexibility is allowed for the request's validity, but the latter must be communicated to the requester in the email thread.

Always use "reply to all" so that the discussion goes to both the mailing list and the requester. If the requester does not do this, forward the message (or a reply that quotes the message) to the email mailing list.

ALL RESERVATION REQUESTS ARE HANDLED IN THE ORDER THEY ARE RECEIVED.

If you can take care of the reservation, approve it by replying to all in the email thread. At the same time, inform the requester about any changes and restrictions, such as changing the end time, etc.

If you approve the reservation and announce it in the email thread, you may move the discussion to another communication channel if you wish.

You may suggest a change to the opening time if you otherwise cannot be there to open the doors.

Once you have approved the reservation, mark it in the calendar.

Handle the reservation until it is fully completed. If something prevents you from taking care of it until the end, immediately inform the keyholders' group and ensure the residents' committee notices this. The most important thing is to communicate clearly to the requester if the reservation must be cancelled or if the communication contact changes.

Try to respond to reservations as soon as you can. If no one else has handled the reservation, respond at the latest 7–4 days before the reservation. All requests must be answered within at least 48 hours.

All reservations follow the same rules that are separately defined for the reserver (otahoas.fi/saannot).

Reservation Validity

A reservation request is valid if:

The requester lives at OtaHoas and is not otherwise banned from reserving OtaHoas resources.

The request information is not incomplete. All fields must be acceptably filled in.

All time formats must be in Finnish time format.

There are no other earlier valid reservation requests for the same time.

The requested time range is reasonable, meaning it falls outside quiet hours.

The request is not intended for someone else, such as an association; it is intended for an OtaHoas resident.

Reservations are personal and for personal use. An exception is made for OtaHoas partner associations.

The reservation request arrives at least 24 hours before the requested time.

Generally, a person can have one reservation at a time for the facilities, one reservation for kayaks and SUP boards, and one reservation for other resources. If there are no other requests for the resource 72 hours before the requested time, it is possible to request multiple reservations for use.

Other Matters

As a keyholder, you may use the space freely whenever there is no reservation.

When you use the space yourself without a reservation, you are responsible for the space and activities there just like during reservations.

If you are leaving and there are no other keyholders present in the space (regardless of whether they are assigned to that space or not), you must remove non-keyholders from the space unless a member of the residents' committee allows an exception.

In such a situation, you may also ask an OtaHoas resident who is present to take responsibility for the space. Taking responsibility means the same responsibility and following the same rules as during reservations, but without the reservation rights to decide alone how the space is used. However, the responsible person has the right to forbid additional new non-keyholders from entering.

If you have questions about OtaHoas operations or these rules and instructions, ask immediately directly from the residents' committee or in the keyholders' group.

Also remember to actively share ideas and development suggestions so the residents' committee can budget money and resources for them!

The most important thing is that being a volunteer is not burdensome, and that everyone has fun and feels comfortable.

Thank you for being a keyholder!

The residents' committee can change anything stated above at any time and in any manner.
